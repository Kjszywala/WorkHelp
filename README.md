This code supports .net 6.0, I did not check this with other versions.

You will need also the newest version of LibUsbDotNet:
NuGet\Install-Package LibUsbDotNet -Version 3.0.97-alpha

LibUsb-Win32 is also needed to run the usb connection code.
After you downloaded and installed LibUsb-Win32 you will need to start this app
and install on the right usb ports which are desplayed when app is on.

To connect to the printer (USB) you will need the serial number.
